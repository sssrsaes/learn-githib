Tofu, or bean curd, is a food made by coagulating soy milk and pressing the curds into solid blocks. It is a versatile and plant-based protein source that can be used in a wide range of dishes, from vegan meat substitutes to puddings and creamy sauces. The production process is similar to that of cheese, and it is a dietary staple in Chinese and Japanese cuisines, with a history spanning over 2,000 years.
